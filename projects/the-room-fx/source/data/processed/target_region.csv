http://twitter.com/gingertrvlguru/status/1874156942194860314,2025-01-01 03:13:29,"I've been musing about the changes to the British Airways ""Club"" from my cabin here in the Yukon. Clearly this was inevitable. With the change to Avios earning being revenue based, this was always going to happen, it was simply a question of when, and how bad the change was going to be. I am struck though by how 'Delta' like the changes are. Perhaps BA/IAG have grown a pair and figured given their network and fortress hub position at LHR, people will fly them regardless, so tough cookies to all of their customers. I think perhaps the trans-Atlantic joint-business had some input into it too, as clearly it was much harder to get status for an EXP or CK than it was Gold or GGL given the hard spend requirements for Loyalty Points. The sad thing is, I think BA may actually be right about people sticking with them. Look at the Lufthansa Group for example. Lufthansa business class is rubbish. Swiss is ok. Coupled with the fact that Miles & More (unless you're HON Circle), is pretty mediocre, and certainly not as good as the Exec Club was, yet people still fly Lufthansa Group because they and United/Air Canada offer non-stop products in the markets with which they serve. Miles & More's switch to a points based system took some elements of the BA programme, but didn't take any of the gamification of the Exec Club that enables tier point running. So it's somewhat of a half-way house and therefore not as engaging. My predictions for 2025 are that BA and IAG will largely stay the course for this one. However I do predict some kind of mid-year tier point credit (perhaps July/August time), like Lufthansa did, when it's clear that fewer people will requalify. However I don't think there will be a significant impact to bookings. The 'US3' and to some extent the Lufthansa changes show us that people will stick with them regardless. So more heat than light for probably longer than people expect, but no big impact to the IAG FY results in 2025.",en,-5,David,MALE,11233,"Random musings on travel and CrossFit, and other stuff",http://twitter.com/gingertrvlguru/,United Kingdom,uk,London,1127,11,0,1,14,11233,TC2_EU,UK,"[""Travel Enthusiast""]",Travel Enthusiast,"[""Price & Miles""]",Delta Air Lines

Shocked travelers say the confrontation started over simple drink requests that spiraled out of control. Before takeoff, the pilot had already warned passengers that “no rudeness toward flight attendants would be tolerated,” setting an oddly tense tone for Flight AA3286. Once in the air, service in first class was delayed for more than an hour while those in economy had already been served, frustrating passengers who say they had done nothing wrong. The bizarre incident happened on October 4th, 2025, aboard an Airbus A321 headed for Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). Witnesses say the flight attendant became defensive and accused a passenger of reporting her to the captain, which he denied. She then told the captain that customers were “mean,” “belligerent,” and “probably drunk,” before locking herself in the galley and refusing to continue service. When the plane landed, she read up to ten passenger names over the PA system, announcing that police would meet them at the gate. Officers did meet the plane but reportedly laughed after hearing what happened and left without taking action. Police later advised airline staff not to use law enforcement as a threat toward passengers.

Pittsburghese, or Western Pennsylvania English, is a distinct American dialect centered in Pittsburgh, known for unique vocabulary (like ""yinz"" for you all, ""buggy"" for shopping cart, ""jimmies"" for sprinkles) and pronunciation influenced by Scots-Irish, German, Slavic, and other immigrant groups, creating a mix of unique phrases and an iconic, often nasal, accent with terms like ""nebby"" (nosy) and ""needs fixed"". Key Features •Vocabulary: Words like ""dahntahn"" (downtown), ""red up"" (clean up), ""clicker"" (remote), and ""slippy"" (slippery) are common. •Pronunciation: A unique nasal quality, particularly in vowels, with a distinctive ""ah"" sound, and mergers like ""cot"" and ""caught"". •Grammar: Usage of ""whenever"" for specific times (""Whenever I get home..."") and the ""needs fixed"" construction (""The car needs washed""). •Influences: A blend of Scots-Irish, German, Slavic, African American, and even Old Norse, from waves of immigration. •Identity: Strongly associated with the working-class community, with speakers called ""Yinzers,"" and celebrated through local culture like t-shirts and media. Examples •Yinz: ""Yinz wanna go for a buggy ride?"" (You all want to go for a shopping cart ride?). •Red up: ""I gotta red up the house."" (I have to clean up the house). •Jimmies: ""Put some jimmies on that ice cream."" (Put sprinkles on that ice cream). Origin and Spread Originating in the 18th century with Scots-Irish settlers, it absorbed influences from subsequent immigrant groups, solidifying into a unique dialect by the mid-20th century, with its distinctiveness becoming a point of local pride and study for linguists. Curt Cignetti was born June 2, 1961, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He is the son of Hall-of-Fame coach Frank Cignetti Sr. Cignetti played quarterback for the West Virginia Mountaineers from 1979 to 1982 under head coaches Frank Cignetti Sr. and Don Nehlen. Actor Jimmy Stewart is from Indiana, Pennsylvania. I never heard anyone I was related to use the words Jimmies or Buggies. James Stewart was often called Jimmy. Although I never met the man, I did see him board a flight from Los Angeles to New York on an American Airlines 747 I was loading bags on down below on the ramp. Later that same year I would fly with Keith Moon in the first row of first class on a Continental Airlines DC- 10 from Los Angeles to Houston for the opening of the The Who’s 1975 US tour. The concert was the following night at The Summit™️. Toots and the Maytals opened. This is detailed in the The Chair 🪑 Volume II: Faith, Hope, & Love. All four of those genius analysis people on Fox picked Ohio State. I apologize for having failed to get a screenshot of it pregame. Biggest victory in Indiana history? I’ll leave that to Hoosier fans. I never saw the Branch McCracken basketball teams play. Also, I found it odd that there was no mention of this being The Game of the Century™️.",en,0,Robert McKenzie,MALE,1825,Republican running for the Texas House of Representatives in District 137 in 2026 in the Great State of Texas ⭐️ .

This service will gradually be introduced across various routes, including regional ones, and will be complimentary for all passengers. The WiFi service aims to replicate the connectivity experience one would expect on the ground, allowing passengers to maintain communication, keep up with news, engage in online gaming, and stream media during their flight. The service will support multiple device connections per passenger, accessible via smartphones, tablets, and laptops. To use the WiFi, passengers will need to log in with their Flying Blue account, though first-class travelers can access it directly without login. For those without an account, one can be created at no cost after boarding. This initiative comes alongside Air France's recent decision to experiment with a paid à la carte meal service on certain European routes, moving away from complimentary in-flight meals. The connectivity will be provided by Starlink's extensive network of low-earth orbit satellites, which ensures wide coverage, with the exception of areas where internet use is restricted. This follows similar moves by airlines like Hawaiian Airlines, which started its Starlink service in February 2024, and United Airlines, which has partnered with SpaceX for similar purposes.",en,5,Redneck Azn,MALE,17889,sarcastic positive lover of soy products.

It’s one of those things people either shrug off or passionately debate like pineapple on pizza or whether socks belong with sandals. But for some of us, it’s not just a background hum... it’s a full-blown soundtrack to our lives. Now, before anyone jumps in with “Didn’t you know there was an airport when you bought your house?” Yes, I did. But here’s the thing: noise is a symptom, not the root cause. It’s like having a fever, it tells you something’s up. And lately, something is up. My Noise vs. Your Noise I live in a low flyover zone about 3.5 miles from the airport. I’ve lived in three different homes in this area since 2014, and I swear the noise has changed, especially in the last two years. It’s not just louder; it’s different. The recent United expansion got me curious, so I started digging into the data. I’ve compiled a report for September 2025 using info from the airport’s own monitoring tools. This focuses on my area, using readings from monitors along the departure and arrival routes. If you live near Black Rail Road or Vista Fire Station #5, you’d need to check your own local data to see how it compares. Tools You Can Use • Noise Dashboard: Created by the San Marcos PAAC rep (with help from the airport manager, I suspect), this dashboard is a goldmine for noise nerds like me. You can explore real data and trends here: 👉 Noise Dashboard: https://t.co/BnWHVAwT1Y • WebTrak: Want to know what just roared over your house? WebTrak lets you track flights and noise levels. There’s a 15–30-minute delay, so jot down the time you heard it and use the replay feature. 👉 WebTrak: https://t.co/BVExdCFbNv What’s That Sound? Let’s break it down: • Small Prop Planes: These are the quiet buzzers. Unless they’re doing aerial acrobatics or having a bad day, they’re barely noticeable. Think of them as the Prius of the skies. • Turboprops: These guys sound like angry weed whackers. They can hit 70–75 dB, which is loud enough to pause a conversation or make your dog give you the side-eye. • Midsize Jets: Your typical business-class birds. They hum like a small industrial machine and get louder as they approach. Not ear-shattering, but definitely noticeable. • Big Jets (JSX, AA, etc.): These are the heavy hitters. JSX jets average around 75 dB over my neighborhood, and American Airlines jets can hit 80 dB—comparable to a Harley or a loud air compressor. Not dangerous for your hearing in short bursts, but enough to spike your blood pressure or make you forget what you were saying. • Aggressive Maneuvers: My personal least favorite. These sudden, loud flyovers feel like the sky is yelling at you. They’ve become more frequent, possibly due to air traffic control managing tighter flight paths. I’ve started documenting these in hopes someone can help figure out a solution. What the Data Says I’ve attached a summary of this month’s WebTrak report. Over the past three months, noise events have increased by 15% compared to last year, with September alone up 9% over September 2024. But here’s the kicker: complaints have skyrocketed, especially since the new monitor was installed near Loker Ave. Vista went from 4 to 197 complaints. San Marcos, despite being one of the most impacted areas, shows fewer complaints. Why? Maybe the complaint system doesn’t recognize our addresses (I’ve tried!), or maybe we’re a windows-shut, grin-and-bear-it kind of crowd. I live about 1,200 feet from the monitor and hear planes often. Most don’t bother me, except those dive-bombers. Those are next-level annoying. Final Thought Noise isn’t just about volume, it’s about impact. If you’ve noticed changes or have insights into the odd data trends, I’d love to hear from you. Let’s keep the conversation going (when the jets aren’t interrupting us).",en,0,RB,UNKNOWN,131,RB Talks Designing Living Spaces With AI,http://twitter.com/RBDesignWorks61/,United States,us,"San Marcos, California",0,0,0,0,0,131,TC1_NA,US,"[""Tech/Digital""]",Tech/Digital,"[""Price & Miles""]",American Airlines

On top of that, he purchased a \$150,000 companion pass so he could bring anyone along. For Steve, travel wasn’t about collecting miles or rewards—it was about freedom without limits, and he used it to the fullest. Over the years, Rothstein booked more than 10,000 flights, sometimes hopping on a plane just to have lunch in another state before returning home the same day. He was known for his generosity, often giving away trips to strangers, helping homeless individuals reunite with their families, or booking seats for companions who never showed up. His unusual habits made him both a legend and a financial headache, as American Airlines eventually calculated that he had cost them over \$21 million. In 2008, the airline revoked his pass, accusing him of misuse. But Rothstein fought back, pointing to the binding contract he had purchased decades earlier. The courts sided with him, and his golden ticket remained valid. Today, Steve Rothstein is remembered not only as the most extraordinary frequent flyer but also as a symbol of how one small clause in a contract can unlock the entire world. © Aviation History #archaeohistories",en,0,Chris Cannon,MALE,698,"it's just personal, nothing business...",http://twitter.com/CC_Rock/,United States,us,"Tallahassee, Florida",0,0,0,0,0,698,TC1_NA,US,"[""Business Traveler""]",Business Traveler,"[""Seat & Comfort"", ""Food & Dining"", ""Price & Miles"", ""Entertainment""]",American Airlines

I really don’t wish anyone to go through this. It felt like flying with Ryanair with that kind of customer service. https://t.co/SCfM22y8bs QT @sash_jpg: A story about @British_Airways I had a flight booked for Thursday to see my dad, who was extremely unwell with Alzheimer’s disease. Sadly, on Sunday, he passed away. I contacted British Airways customer service, and they told me not to worry they could move me to an earlier flight. The only option available connected via Nairobi. As it was a 26-hour journey, I asked to upgrade to the maximum possible. I was told there was no Business Class available, despite my return ticket being Business (Club World). The agent who helped rebook the flight reassured me and specifically said, “Don’t worry, you’ll be able to use our lounges during the connection.” When I arrived in Nairobi, no one could tell me which lounge I was allowed to use. The British Airways team said their lounge was only available if I was upgraded to Club World again. Their connecting flight partner said I couldn’t use their lounge either. None of my cards Amex, Revolut Gold, or anything else worked. I messaged British Airways repeatedly, explaining that I was stuck in the airport, hadn’t eaten for two days, and was travelling immediately after losing my father. I didn’t asked for any other help, I just needed somewhere to rest. There was zero empathy and no effort to resolve the situation. Almost no concern at all. Even your cabin crew were shocked that no hotel, lounge access, or basic support had been arranged for me. So thank you, British Airways. You can call yourself whatever kind of airline you want but when I needed you the most, you didn’t show up. In the end I upgraded my connection flight via their partner airline directly. The lesson here: don’t waste your time on loyalty. It doesn’t pay nor it comes when you need it the most.

He had noticed a girl was waiting for the bathroom and told her to come with him to the first-class bathroom. Before entering the lavatory, Thompson said he needed to wash his hands. When inside the bathroom, he taped his phone to the seat. The girl didn't notice the phone until she got up. She took a picture to show her mother. (seen below) The mother then told her father who confronted Thompson in the back of the plane where a ""kerfuffle"" went down, according to the family's lawyer.

Pentecost was a member of the cabin crew, not a passenger, and was on duty at the time of the incident. Details of the incident: •Behavior: Colleagues described him as ""dishevelled, pale, sweaty and erratic"" before he locked himself in the business class lavatory. When he emerged, he was ""completely naked and oblivious"" to the fact, babbling incoherently. •Response: A co-worker dressed him and moved him to an empty seat. The captain was alerted, and a medical professional on board was called to monitor him for the rest of the flight. •Aftermath: Upon landing at Heathrow Airport, paramedics met the aircraft and took him to the hospital. Blood tests confirmed the presence of methamphetamine and amphetamines in his system. He was later dismissed by British Airways. •Legal Outcome: Pentecost pleaded guilty to performing an aviation function while impaired by drugs. In September 2025, he received a six-month prison sentence, suspended for a year, along with 80 hours of unpaid work. The judge noted that no passengers were aware of his condition during the flight.",en,-5,Kim Marshall,MALE,2022,"Avid activist & supporter of the Democratic Party!! HUGE fan of Jesus Christ.

He had noticed a girl was waiting for the bathroom and told her to come with him to the first-class bathroom. Before entering the lavatory, Thompson said he needed to wash his hands. When inside the bathroom, he taped his phone to the seat. The girl didn't notice the phone until she got up. She took a picture to show her mother. (seen below) The mother then told her father who confronted Thompson in the back of the plane where a ""kerfuffle"" went down, according to the family's lawyer.

That reaction says more about today’s airline industry than about one airplane seat. Passengers have been conditioned to expect shrinking legroom, extra fees for basic comfort, and cabins designed more for revenue optimization than human dignity. So when a single seat offers space to breathe, stretch, and exist without apology, it feels like an exception—almost a miracle. This was likely an exit row or a specific aircraft configuration, not a system-wide policy change. But that’s precisely the point. Comfort has been elevated to a privilege, rather than a standard. Airlines sell “extra” legroom as if dignity were a luxury add-on rather than a baseline expectation. The viral video didn’t celebrate WestJet. It exposed how low the bar has fallen. When basic comfort becomes newsworthy, the industry should ask itself a hard question: When did treating passengers like cargo become normal? Because people aren’t asking for first class. They’re asking for space to sit—without viral proof that it’s even possible. #CPRMRadio #EditorialCartoon #SymbolicArt #AirlineIndustry #PassengerRights #TravelReality #EconomyClass #Legroom #ComfortVsProfit #HumanDignity #ModernTravel #WhatWentWrong",en,-5,CPRM Radyo 🇨🇦🇵🇭🇮🇱,MALE,2421,CPRM Radio 🎙 | Home of OPM • Music • News • Audit Watch • Montreal–Philippines link  To Support: https://t.co/M1P5QspScF,http://twitter.com/cprm013113/,Canada,ca,Montreal,762,5,1,2,9,2421,TC1_NA,CA,"[""Tech/Digital""]",Tech/Digital,"[""Seat & Comfort"", ""Lounge"", ""Price & Miles"", ""Entertainment""]",Other

He had noticed a girl was waiting for the bathroom and told her to come with him to the first-class bathroom. Before entering the lavatory, Thompson said he needed to wash his hands. When inside the bathroom, he taped his phone to the seat. The girl didn't notice the phone until she got up. She took a picture to show her mother.

You’ll need luck on that trip!” A couple months later my wife went back for a trim. “So, how was Florida?” “Wonderful,” she said. “We flew on a brand-new American airline plane, got bumped to first class, had amazing food and wine, and a handsome young man waited on us hand and foot.” “The hotel had just had a 5 million dollar remodel. They were overbooked and gave us the owner’s suite for free!” “Yeah, yeah,” muttered the hairdresser. “But you didn’t see President Trump.” “Actually,” my wife said, “A secret service agent tapped me on the shoulder and asked if I’d like to meet him privately.” “Five minutes later, President Trump walked in, shook my hand, and spoke to me.” “Oh really?” sneered the hairdresser. “What did he say?” My wife smiled and replied, “Who the hell did your hair, that looks like sh*t, what a loser!”",en,-5,Darla,FEMALE,1530,"I ban DM bots and scammers that state: I'll share my lottery winnings, I wanna be your boo, SOS for cash, sex & those that steal names to make a quick buck.",http://twitter.com/Blair2002Db/,United States,us,"Pierre, South Dakota",0,1,0,0,1,1530,TC1_NA,US,[],Unclassified,"[""Seat & Comfort"", ""Food & Dining"", ""Service"", ""Price & Miles"", ""Entertainment""]",American Airlines

He had noticed a girl was waiting for the bathroom and told her to come with him to the first-class bathroom. Before entering the lavatory, Thompson said he needed to wash his hands. When inside the bathroom, he taped his phone to the seat. The girl didn't notice the phone until she got up. She took a picture to show her mother. (seen below) The mother then told her father who confronted Thompson in the back of the plane where a ""kerfuffle"" went down, according to the family's lawyer.

First, the crash. Air France 4590, 25 July 2000. A strip of metal on the runway, a burst tyre, a fuel tank ripped open, fire, 113 dead. Horrible. Unforgivable in the sense that it was preventable. The investigation was brutal in its honesty: the tank design had a known vulnerability, the spacer strips between the ply layers in the tyres were missing on some wheels, runway debris discipline at CDG was lax. The fixes came fast—Kevlar liners in the tanks, better tyres, Michelin NZGs that wouldn’t shred the same way, FOD walks on runways, even little deflectors ahead of the gear. By 2001 the fleet was back in the air, certificates renewed. And people flew. Loads were solid. Celebrities, bankers, the merely rich who wanted New York breakfast and London dinner. I’ve talked to cabin crew from those last two years—they said the mood on board was almost defiant, like “we’re still here.” Then the numbers. This is where I start to waver. A Concorde overhaul cost roughly the same as buying a new widebody. Fuel burn was monstrous—four times a 747 per seat. The ozone scare (later mostly debunked) and the post-9/11 drop in premium travel hurt badly. Airbus announced they’d stop supporting the A300-600 airframe donor parts, and without Airbus the Type Certificate was toast. British Airways and Air France looked at the ledger and quietly concluded that even at $12,000 a ticket they were losing money on every flight once you rolled in the capital costs. But… but. Today I can drop $15–25k on a Qatar Qsuite or an Emirates first-class shower suite and barely blink, because half the cabin is paying it. London–New York business class is routinely $8–12k round-trip now, often more. The infra has improved—better runways, better ATC, quieter engines were already in development (the “Olympus 593 Mk 610” that never flew would have cut noise dramatically). Carbon brakes, fly-by-wire retrofits—none of it impossible. Expensive, yes. Absurdly so? Maybe not, if someone had really wanted it. This is where the doubt creeps in. Because no one did want it enough. Not the airlines (BA was bleeding cash post-9/11), not the manufacturers (Airbus wanted out), not the regulators (the FAA never gave full domestic overland rights anyway), and—here’s the part that stings—not the public either. We mourned her, we bought the posters, but we didn’t march in the streets or refuse to fly subsonic. We posted grainy videos on YouTube and moved on. Was it politics? In a way, yes. The loudest anti-Concorde voices were always political—green groups who hated the fuel burn, American airlines who hated the competitive threat and lobbied against overland routes, French and British governments quietly relieved to be rid of a prestige project that had become a money pit. The crash simply handed everyone the perfect excuse they were waiting for. I go back and forth. One day I’m convinced she could have been saved—re-engine with something derived from the Trent, sell 10 refurbished airframes to boutique operators for $20–30k a seat, turn her into the ultimate Veblen good. The next day I look at the maintenance logs and think, “My God, what a fragile, thirsty, noisy beast—she was a miracle we got 27 years out of her.” Maybe the truth is gentler than conspiracy and harsher than nostalgia: Concorde represented a moment when governments and companies were still willing to lose money for the way people lose money on art—because beauty and ambition mattered. That moment passed. Not because of one crash, not because of one Airworthiness Directive, but because we slowly, quietly, decided that three-and-a-half hours from London to New York wasn’t worth the poetry anymore. And yet every time I see that delta wing against a sunset, I feel the same thing I felt as a child a tug in the chest that says we gave up something irreplaceable.

http://twitter.com/MansaTesla/status/2011407755374919822,2026-01-14 20:59:13,"📉 Inflation bites. 🛍️ The wealthy keep spending. 🤖 AI carries the market. ⚖️ And Washington is playing with fire. The search for stability has led investors to an unexpected place: economic data. After months of disruption, US inflation data is finally back on schedule — and it delivers an uncomfortable truth. 🔸 CPI is running at 2.7% 🔸 Beef prices up 16% 🔸 Natural gas up ~11% 🔸 Eating out rising at an 8%+ annual pace Think of inflation like a slow leak in your wallet. You don’t notice it every day — until the bills start piling up. That pressure hasn’t gone away for ordinary Americans. Yet here’s the paradox… 💳 Premium spending is alive and well Earnings season tells a different story — especially at the top end. JPMorgan Chase beat expectations across most of its business lines. CEO Jamie Dimon struck an unusually calm tone: 🔸 Consumers are still spending 🔸 Businesses remain healthy 🔸 Labour markets have softened — but not cracked Now look at airlines. Delta Air Lines missed some forecasts, and the stock was punished — yet management made one thing crystal clear: 🔸 Almost all future growth comes from premium customers In plain terms: The economy is splitting in two. Those at the top are still flying first class. Everyone else is feeling turbulence. 📊 Markets are unforgiving right now So far this earnings season: 🔸 Only a few companies missed expectations 🔸 But those misses were punished twice as hard as usual Think of the market like a stressed referee — no second chances, no benefit of the doubt. 🤖 AI is carrying the scoreboard Wall Street expects S&P 500 earnings to grow ~8%, marking a 10th straight quarter of growth. But peel back the curtain and you see something crucial: 🔸 Most optimism is concentrated in tech 🔸 And tech optimism is concentrated in AI 🔸 And AI expectations are concentrated in one company That company is Nvidia. Remove Nvidia, and tech’s earnings growth drops sharply. Analogy time: The market is riding a single engine at cruising altitude. It’s powerful — but everyone is watching that engine very closely. If Nvidia stumbles, Mr Market won’t be forgiving. ⚖️ Meanwhile in Washington: a dangerous game As all this unfolds, political pressure on the Federal Reserve is escalating. President Donald Trump has publicly attacked Fed Chair Jerome Powell, even as DOJ subpoenas hover in the background. This matters more than most people realise. When politicians threaten central bank independence, markets hear one thing: 🔸 Higher inflation expectations 🔸 Higher long-term interest rates 🔸 A weaker currency over time As Jamie Dimon put it plainly: Interference backfires. It’s like yelling at a thermostat and expecting the room to cool down faster — instead, you blow the fuse. 🪙 The old lesson returns History keeps repeating itself: 🔸 Rising debt 🔸 Political pressure 🔸 Currency dilution That’s why investors always circle back to hard assets — especially gold — when trust in institutions starts to fray. 🧭 Bottom line We are in a strange moment: 🔸 Inflation still hurts everyday life 🔸 The wealthy keep spending 🔸 AI is propping up markets 🔸 Politics is testing monetary credibility Stability feels scarce — but the signals are there if you know where to look.

Hier, Le Journal de Montréal a publié une fausse nouvelle en déformant les propos de PSPP à l'émission Sucré Salé! PSPP a mentionné ""Il y a une partie de mon indépendantisme d'ailleurs qui découle de l'absence de français et d'un certain mépris pour la différence québécoise sur les lignes aériennes d'Air Canada. J'avais 22-23 ans (en 1999-2000) et j'étais très mauvais en classe affaires..."". Suite à cette déclaration, Québecor a décidé de publier un article dans ses journaux, mentionnant que PSPP est devenu indépendantiste à l'époque où il était agent de bord pour Air Canada (en 1999-2000). Premièrement, il affirme simplement qu'une partie de ses valeurs indépendantistes viennent de cette époque, il ne dit pas qu'il est devenu indépendantiste à ce moment! Deuxièmement, PSPP ne pourra jamais mentionner qu'il est devenu indépendantiste avant mai 2016, la date où celui-ci a décidé de se présenter à la course à la chefferie du PQ pour remplace PKP, le boss de Québecor. PSPP sait qu'il ne pourra jamais affirmer qu'il était souverainiste avant 2016 (à 39 ans), puisque dans ses livres et entrevues, il y a des preuves qu'il n'était pas souverainiste. D'ailleurs, en 2014, dans son livre ""Les Orphelins politiques"", il critique sévèrement le projet souverainiste. En 2020, dans une entrevue, il parle même de son passé de fédéraliste lorsqu'il était avocat chez Stikeman Elliot de 2002 à 2009. Donc, la question qu'on doit se poser, c'est pourquoi Québecor a inventé et publié cette fausse nouvelle mentionnant que PSPP est devenu indépendantiste en 1999-2000? #polqc #assnat #polcan",fr,-5,Pierre Meloche,MALE,237,"payeur de taxes écoeurer  , ex commerçant durant 30 ans",http://twitter.com/pierremeloche8/,Canada,ca,Montreal,0,0,0,0,0,237,TC1_NA,CA,[],Unclassified,"[""Seat & Comfort"", ""Food & Dining""]",Air Canada

American Airlines instituted a new policy where you have to pay to take a carry-on onto the plane. Which is ridiculous but off topic. I consolidate my bags into one and they measure it and say it’s just a little too big. They proceed to charge me $50, except they only take credit card, no cash. Since I just got back from Europe all my cards are being declined as Chase doesn’t know I’m back. They tell me that I’m going to have to miss the flight and head back to the ticket counter to pay down there. I’m pleading, devastated after a long day of travel. Then, this man walks up and says, “How much is it?” They tell him $50 and he says “I got it.” I’m astonished and tell him it’s fine not to worry and he hands the lady his card as the American Airlines employees stand in silence shocked by this man’s generosity. They swipe the card and he tells me to have a great flight and hop on board. I’m crying as I write this and as I board the flight. This man was an angel. I stop him as he’s sitting in first class and try to give him my money but he just shook me off and told me to pay it forward. My heart is so happy. There are good people in this world.

We booked Business class tickets for our family to Italy for my daughter’s elopement this summer. This was a big splurge for us. Something we’ve never done, and will never be able to afford to do again. We were so excited, that we booked all the way back in September. Our flight times have now changed, which is totally understandable considering we booked so early, but the alternative flights they put us on don’t allow enough time to transfer, so we’ve had to change flights. We tried to explain that everything has all ready been booked for the wedding, like lodging, transfers, venue, vendors, and that we couldn’t make any major changes. The people we spoke to could not have cared less. It was 100% not what I expected from a company like yours. We’ve spent weeks trying to get assistance from British Airways, and not one call center employee can answer a single question. Anything they do tell us, doesn’t make any sense, and when we show them, like physically show them how that doesn’t make sense, they just say they don’t know why it’s doing that, or blame it on your computer system. I’m trying so hard not to be a Karen, but I need to speak to someone who knows something, and who can actually do something. I’ve been dealing with an emotional and stressed out bride for over a year now. I am literally down to my last nerve and my last penny. And being treated so flippantly by a company that we have spent so much of our hard earned money with, it is about to send me right on over the edge. Her fiancé’s family is flying @united, who we’re actually all card holders and Mileage Plus members of, and we’re seriously kicking ourselves for not following suit.

Und dann gibt es Luisa Neubauer, die das Wort „Kampf“ mit „Instagram-Filter“ verwechselt. Sie ist das deutsche Gesicht von Fridays for Future, eine Art Greta Thunberg mit WLAN und Lufthansa-Kundenkarte. Ihr größter Beitrag zur Gesellschaft? Moralpredigten mit erhobenem Zeigefinger, während sie selbst in einer Komfortzone lebt, von der normale Menschen nur träumen können. Neubauer verkauft sich als Stimme der Jugend, als letzte Hoffnung des Planeten – doch unter der Oberfläche findet sich weniger Ideologie als in einer Werbekampagne für nachhaltige Smoothies. Die Erbin aus Zwangsarbeit – Moralische Überlegenheit auf Kosten der Geschichte Luisa Neubauer spricht oft über Gerechtigkeit, doch ihre eigene Familie hat ihr Vermögen nicht gerade mit Fairtrade-Kaffee oder Bio-Avocados verdient. Ihre Familie ist Teil des Reemtsma-Clans, einem Zigarettenimperium, das während der NS-Zeit durch Zwangsarbeit riesige Gewinne erzielte. Nun gut, kann ja keiner was für seine Familie, oder? Doch wenn man sich selbst als moralische Instanz aufspielt, wäre ein Mindestmaß an Selbstreflexion nicht zu viel verlangt. Neubauer jedoch schweigt zu diesem Kapitel lieber – offenbar ist sie zu sehr damit beschäftigt, anderen Leuten zu erklären, wie sie ihr Leben zu führen haben. Der moderne Rattenfänger – mit Filterblase und PR-Team Neubauer hat ein Talent: Sie verkauft grüne Ideologie wie ein Tech-Startup CEO seine neueste App. Einfache Lösungen für komplexe Probleme („Einfach aufhören mit fossilen Energien, dann klappt das!“). Panik als Dauermodus („Die Welt brennt, wir müssen sofort handeln – außer, wenn ich zum nächsten Event fliege!“). Junge Leute mit utopischen Versprechen einfangen, während sie selbst im Luxus lebt. Sie ist der moderne Rattenfänger von Hameln, nur dass sie statt einer Flöte einen Twitter-Account und ein ARD-Mikrofon hat. Während sie mit entrücktem Blick und dramatischen Worten die Apokalypse verkündet, marschiert ihre Gefolgschaft in Richtung wirtschaftlicher Selbstzerstörung – und klatscht dabei begeistert. Fliegen, Feiern, Fordern – Klima-Aktivismus auf First-Class-Niveau Einer ihrer bekanntesten „Ausrutscher“ war die Diskussion um ihre eigenen Flugreisen. Während sie anderen vorschreibt, dass Fliegen böse ist, jettete sie selbst fröhlich durch die Weltgeschichte. Ihre Antwort? „Ich hatte ja keine Wahl.“ Genau. Weil es ja auch keine Züge gibt. Oder Videokonferenzen. Oder einen Funken Konsequenz in ihren eigenen Forderungen. Neubauer lebt in einem Widerspruchskosmos, in dem für sie selbst andere Regeln gelten als für die „dummen Massen“. Während sie sich an Kohlekraftwerken festklebt, um „die Zukunft zu retten“, müssen normale Bürger schauen, wie sie mit explodierenden Energiepreisen klarkommen. Grüne Heuchelei auf höchstem Niveau Neubauer ist die Inkarnation der grünen Doppelmoral. Von Reemtsma-Geld profitieren, aber Kapitalismus abschaffen wollen. Fliegen, aber Flugreisen für andere verteufeln. Grünen Kommunismus fordern, aber selbst luxuriös leben. Während sie den Untergang der Welt predigt, macht sie sich ihre eigene Zukunft goldgrün: Buchverträge, Medienauftritte, Lobbytreffen – ein Aktivismus, der vor allem einem Zweck dient: ihrer eigenen Karriere. Das Fazit: Klima-Heilige oder clevere Geschäftsfrau? Luisa Neubauer ist kein Umweltengel. Sie ist eine perfekt inszenierte PR-Maschine. Ihre Kampagne hat mit echter Wissenschaft oder nachhaltiger Politik so viel zu tun wie ein Tesla mit Umweltschutz – klingt gut, sieht gut aus, ist aber am Ende doch nur Marketing. Die Frage ist: Wie lange lassen sich die Leute noch täuschen? Solange die Kameras blitzen und die Medien sie als „letzte Hoffnung des Planeten“ verkaufen, wird Luisa Neubauer weiter ihre Show abziehen. Doch irgendwann – wenn selbst ihre eigenen Jünger merken, dass sie nichts weiter als ein grünes Hochglanzprodukt ist – könnte ihr Stern genauso schnell verglühen, wie sie ihn selbst angezündet hat. Und dann? Wird sie vielleicht doch noch ins Familienunternehmen einsteigen – und sich einen neuen Slogan überlegen: „Nachhaltig qualmen mit Reemtsma“? #neubauer",de,-5,Harly9,UNKNOWN,23,"……..Pictures are silent Friends.

This plane has been used by numerous countries for both passenger and cargo operations. However, its production has ceased, but it remains in service with airlines like Lufthansa and Korean Air for some passenger routes, and significantly in cargo versions by carriers like Atlas Air. - **Inside**: The upper deck of the 747 is smaller than the main cabin but often used for luxury or business class. It's like a VIP room in the sky where the elite can escape the common folk, but without the champagne fountains you'd expect in such an exclusive club. 2. **Airbus A380**: This is the full double-decker jetliner with both decks running the length of the fuselage. It's operated by airlines from countries like the UAE (Emirates), Singapore (Singapore Airlines), Australia (Qantas), and others. - **Inside**: The A380 is like a flying palace with its spacious interior. The upper deck is often where you'll find the swanky business and first-class cabins, sometimes with lounges and even shower spas, because why not freshen up at 35,000 feet? The main deck typically houses economy and premium economy. It's like having a party where the cool kids hang out upstairs, and the rest of us mingle with the snack bar downstairs. Countries where these planes operate include: - **United Arab Emirates**: Emirates is the largest operator of the A380, with Dubai International Airport as a major hub. - **Singapore**: Singapore Airlines, one of the first operators of the A380. - **France**: Air France has flown the A380, although they've been reducing their fleet. - **Germany**: Lufthansa has utilized both the A380 and 747-8 for long-haul flights. - **South Korea**: Korean Air has operated the 747 and A380 for international routes. - **Australia**: Qantas has used the A380 for routes like Melbourne to Los Angeles. The trend towards double-deckers has waned with a shift towards more fuel-efficient, twin-engine aircraft, but these giants still grace the skies in some parts of the world, offering that unique experience of flying in a plane that feels more like a vertical community than a traditional aircraft.",en,0,Milton Laene Araujo,MALE,878,I worked for the group FIAT in Brasil as foreman  for six years.

Investment banker Steven Rothstein, a frequent flyer, bought one immediately. In 1989 he added a $150,000 companion pass that let anyone fly with him—even on separate flights. From 1987 to 2008, Rothstein averaged 476 flights per year (over 10,000 total, 30 million miles). He flew to London for dinner, Tokyo for sushi, Sydney for weekends—treating planes like buses. He used the companion pass for profound kindness: spotting stranded travelers, homeless people, priests, or refugees at airports and gifting them first-class seats home. His daughter said he turned the pass into a tool for random, life-changing generosity. American Airlines sold just 66 passes (1981–1988), raising $16.5 million. Early on, the CEO wrote Rothstein praising his use and promising to honor the deal “far into the future.” By 2007, facing losses, the airline created a “revenue integrity unit.” It calculated Rothstein and one other holder were each costing >$1 million yearly. From 2005–2008 he booked 3,000+ segments for himself (84% canceled/no-show) and 2,700 companion segments (85% unused). Many bookings used placeholder names (“Bag Rothstein,” “Steven Rothstein Jr.”) because he decided at the gate whom to help. Reservations were made by phone; staff knew and never objected—some even suggested the practice. On December 13, 2008, at Chicago O’Hare, while escorting a Bosnian policeman he was flying home, Rothstein was handed a letter revoking his AAirpass for “fraudulent usage.” His 21-year unlimited life ended instantly. The airline accused him of speculative bookings and fake names. Rothstein sued for breach of contract; AA countersued for fraud. The case settled confidentially in 2012 after AA’s bankruptcy. A deeper truth emerged in court: after his teenage son Josh died in 2002, many late-night bookings were grief-driven calls to familiar reservation agents—his only human contact when loneliness was unbearable. The unused tickets weren’t fraud; they were a heartbroken father staying tethered to the world. American Airlines later terminated all remaining AAirpasses. Former CEO Bob Crandall admitted: “The public was smarter than we were.” Rothstein never accepted wrongdoing but later said he had mixed feelings about ever buying the pass. It gave him freedom and the power to help thousands—yet ended in betrayal. His story is the last real unlimited lifetime airline pass: a brief era when a golden ticket actually meant forever, until corporate promises met bottom-line reality. For 10,000 flights and 30 million miles, Steven Rothstein lived—and shared—a dream that no longer exists.",en,0,Allen Mashburn,MALE,27341,"Contributor- The Blaze, The Jenna Ellis Show, Eric Metaxas Show, Salem News, RAV, The Stream, American Greatness, Human Events, AFR, Newsmax; Doctoral student",http://twitter.com/Mashburn4NC/,United States,us,"Raleigh, North Carolina",1206,38,10,0,54,27341,TC1_NA,US,"[""Business Traveler""]",Business Traveler,"[""Seat & Comfort"", ""Food & Dining"", ""Service"", ""Price & Miles"", ""Entertainment""]",American Airlines

Jones stood up in first class to retrieve his luggage from the overhead bin, which prompted fellow passenger James Dos Santos to confront him and push him in the chest. Jones responded by grabbing Dos Santos' arm and telling him to stop, after which Dos Santos apologized. However, another passenger, Alexander Lekht (who was traveling with Dos Santos), began screaming at Jones from his seat. Airport deputies were called to the gate due to the initial confrontation, but Jones declined to file a report at that time and proceeded to baggage claim. Lekht followed Jones and continued to harass him, making sudden movements in an attempt to provoke him further. The situation escalated into a physical altercation on a nearby escalator, where Lekht swung punches at Jones, leading Jones to throw Lekht down the escalator. Dos Santos then joined in by throwing punches at Jones as well. During the brawl, a 94-year-old bystander named James Jackson was knocked to the ground and sustained minor leg injuries, requiring transport to a hospital. Jones maintained that he acted in self-defense throughout the incident, stating, ""I was minding my business and defended myself. They got what they were looking for.""

The US upper-ish class has too much money, but never enough. Lots of suspicious “pre-boarders,” teens in designer clothes, $500 headphones muttering ‘what?’ to flight staff. There are like 50 people in “boarding group 1” now, as well. You can see the confusion on people’s faces who’ve clearly been boarding first for a while, who now wait 20 minutes standing just to have their spot in line! The lounges are overrun, and again, you can see the exasperation on the faces of people waiting for them, thinking they’d paid for a service and realizing that now it’s like Disneyworld. Prices across the board have gone up, and demand keeps up. This is one of the effects of mass affluence, I guess. Airline taxes are as high as ever, and as a result actual “budget” flights (à la Ryanair) are not allowed. At this point, a budget flight is anything under… $300? People are amazingly unforgiving. They get violent looks in their eyes when staff announce that overhead bin space will run out. For many flyers, being asked to check a bag is like being asked for one of their kidneys. So many people look at children like they’re rodents that have infiltrated the house, rather than our treasures and our future. Parents are the scapegoat of every flight. Funny enough, the TSA feels like the one thing that has gotten better. Maybe I choose my airports and flying times well, but I don’t remember the last time I waited more than 15 minutes to get through. Sometimes the CLEAR line is comically longer than the regular line next to it. And for whatever reason, people will just _not_ move over to the shorter line. It’s pretty rare to see actual brawling, but you do hear about these things. As a writer and chronicler of America, this entropy interests me. I’m almost immunized from feeling the pressure, because I’ve taught myself to laugh about it and observe. I see the story, and as a result the chaos isn’t so bad. And to me, mass affluence is the biggest story in the country. People who thought they’d “made it” are stuck in a Commons that they feel has degraded. They’re in a race to constant fly all around the country, and even the ones with quite a bit of money are feeling the squeeze. At the Santa Barbara airport recently, about to board an upsetting expensive, 38 minute flight to San Francisco, I saw this in its purest form. Everyone flying from SB to SF is “rich.” Nearly all live in multimillion-dollar houses. And there they were, watching private jets take off through the windows, about to board a full commercial flight themselves. Affluenza. Me? I try to always feel the wonder. Isn’t it amazing how quickly we can get basically anywhere? It seems so soul destroying to develop an entitlement here. The US is what it is. And it’s a machine to make services widely available at a market price. The chaos begins when a lot more people get pretty wealthy; you see this same pattern in ski resorts, housing markets, etc. Already we see lots of cultural messaging encouraging people to “exit” from all this — either by amassing enough money, or by voluntarily choosing slower things (trains, small towns, camping).

Investigators were shocked to find that Thompson had videos of children (aged 7, 9, 11, & 14) from other flights. Thompson was finally caught after an incident in late 2023. He had noticed a girl was waiting for the bathroom and told her to come with him to the first-class bathroom. Before entering the lavatory, Thompson said he needed to wash his hands. When inside the bathroom, he taped his phone to the seat. The girl didn't notice the phone until she got up. She took a picture to show her mother. (seen below) The mother then told her father who confronted Thompson in the back of the plane where a ""kerfuffle"" went down, according to the family's lawyer.

Investigators were shocked to find that Thompson had videos of children (aged 7, 9, 11, & 14) from other flights. Thompson was finally caught after an incident in late 2023. He had noticed a girl was waiting for the bathroom and told her to come with him to the first-class bathroom. Before entering the lavatory, Thompson said he needed to wash his hands. When inside the bathroom, he taped his phone to the seat. The girl didn't notice the phone until she got up. She took a picture to show her mother. (seen below) The mother then told her father who confronted Thompson in the back of the plane where a ""kerfuffle"" went down, according to the family's lawyer.

He had noticed a girl was waiting for the bathroom and told her to come with him to the first-class bathroom. Before entering the lavatory, Thompson said he needed to wash his hands. When inside the bathroom, he taped his phone to the seat. The girl didn't notice the phone until she got up. She took a picture to show her mother. (seen below) The mother then told her father who confronted Thompson in the back of the plane where a ""kerfuffle"" went down, according to the family's lawyer.

Estes Carter Thompson III was caught secretly filming a 14-year-old girl using the bathroom by taping his phone to the back of the toilet. Investigators were shocked to find that Thompson had videos of children (aged 7, 9, 11, & 14) from other flights. Thompson was finally caught after an incident in late 2023. He had noticed a girl was waiting for the bathroom and told her to come with him to the first-class bathroom. Before entering the lavatory, Thompson said he needed to wash his hands. When inside the bathroom, he taped his phone to the seat. The girl didn't notice the phone until she got up. She took a picture to show her mother. (seen below) The mother then told her father who confronted Thompson in the back of the plane where a ""kerfuffle"" went down, according to the family's lawyer. Thompson faces up to 20 years in prison for child exploitation.

http://twitter.com/MaksPracht/status/1916416569892081762,2025-04-27 17:58:10,"# Lufthansa-Notfall: iPad im Sitz führt zu Flugumkehr 🔥✈️ *@charter_97* 📱🛬 ## Technologie und Flugrisiken: Wenn Alltagsgeräte zur Gefahr werden In einer bemerkenswerten Wendung der Ereignisse musste kürzlich ein Lufthansa-Flug von Los Angeles nach München umkehren, nachdem das iPad eines Business-Class-Passagiers in seinem Sitz eingeklemmt wurde. Der Vorfall wirft wichtige Fragen zur Sicherheit elektronischer Geräte an Bord von Flugzeugen auf. #Flugsicherheit #TechRisiken Der Airbus mit 461 Personen an Bord befand sich bereits seit drei Stunden im Luftraum, als die Besatzung die schwerwiegende Entscheidung traf, nach Los Angeles zurückzukehren. Trotz mehrerer Versuche gelang es der Crew nicht, das Gerät zu befreien, was zu wachsenden Bedenken hinsichtlich einer möglichen Brandgefahr führte. 🚨 ### Experten warnen vor versteckten Gefahren 🧐 ""Eingeklemmte Lithium-Ionen-Batterien stellen ein erhebliches Sicherheitsrisiko dar,"" erklärt Prof. Dr. Klaus Weber, Experte für Luftfahrtsicherheit an der TU München. ""Bei Verformung können diese Batterien überhitzen und in Brand geraten – ein Szenario, das auf 10.000 Meter Höhe absolut vermieden werden muss."" #Batteriesicherheit Die International Air Transport Association (IATA) hat in den letzten Jahren wiederholt auf die Gefahren aufmerksam gemacht, die von elektronischen Geräten ausgehen können. ""Es ist nicht das erste Mal, dass ein eingeklemmtes Gerät einen Notfall verursacht,"" bemerkt Luftfahrtanalystin Sabine Hoffmann. ""2019 musste ein Virgin Atlantic Flug ähnlich umkehren, nachdem ein Smartphone in einem Sitz einen Brandgeruch verursacht hatte."" 📊 ### Konsequenzen für Passagiere und Fluggesellschaft 💼 Für die betroffenen Reisenden bedeutete dieser Vorfall eine erhebliche Verzögerung ihrer Reisepläne. Lufthansa organisierte Ersatzflüge und Unterkünfte, doch der finanzielle und logistische Aufwand war beträchtlich. ""Solche Vorfälle kosten Fluggesellschaften durchschnittlich zwischen 100.000 und 200.000 Euro,"" schätzt Wirtschaftsexperte Dr. Thomas Reichart. ""Neben den direkten Kosten für Treibstoff und Unterbringung kommt es zu Folgeverschiebungen im gesamten Flugplan."" #Wirtschaftsfaktor ### Verhaltensempfehlungen für Reisende 📝 Um ähnliche Vorfälle zu vermeiden, empfehlen Experten: - Elektronische Geräte während der Sitzverstellung im Blick behalten 👀 - Bei Verlust eines Geräts sofort das Kabinenpersonal informieren ✋ - Auf stark beschädigte Geräte an Bord verzichten 🚫 - Powerbanks und Ersatzbatterien nur im Handgepäck transportieren 🧳 ### Zukunftsperspektiven: Sitzdesign und Technik 🔮 Flugzeughersteller arbeiten bereits an verbesserten Sitzdesigns, die solche Vorfälle vermeiden sollen. ""Wir entwickeln Sitzmechanismen, die elektronische Geräte erkennen und den Verstellmechanismus automatisch stoppen,"" erklärt Ingenieurin Marlene Koster von einem führenden Flugzeugsitzhersteller. ""Sicherheit muss mit dem digitalen Zeitalter Schritt halten."" #Innovation Bis diese neuen Technologien flächendeckend eingesetzt werden, bleibt Vorsicht das oberste Gebot. Wie der Lufthansa-Vorfall zeigt, können selbst alltägliche Geräte unter bestimmten Umständen zu ernsthaften Sicherheitsrisiken werden. ### Fazit: Bewusstsein schafft Sicherheit 💭 Der Vorfall unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit eines bewussteren Umgangs mit Elektronik an Bord. ""Passagiere sollten ihre Geräte stets im Blick behalten und vorsichtig mit der Sitzverstellung umgehen,"" rät Kabinenchef Martin Berger. ""Im Zweifel immer die Crew informieren – besser einmal zu viel als zu wenig."" #Sicherheitstipps --- *Dieser Artikel basiert auf verfügbaren Informationen zum Lufthansa-Vorfall.

Subject: Suggestion for a Fairer Aeroplan Program Update Dear Air Canada Aeroplan Team, As loyal Air Canada customers, we’re concerned about the upcoming changes to the Aeroplan program shifting to a spend-based model starting January 2026. While we understand the intent to reward higher spending, this change risks alienating frequent flyers who prioritize travel distance over cost, like budget-conscious long-haul travelers. We propose a hybrid approach to make the program more inclusive and rewarding for all members. For example, award points based on both dollars spent and miles flown—say, 1 point per dollar spent plus 1 point per 100 miles flown, with multipliers like 1.5x for flex fares and 2x for business class. This would fairly reward both high spenders and loyal travelers racking up miles, ensuring everyone feels valued. We believe this balanced system would retain a broader range of customers, from elite frequent flyers to cost-conscious travelers, keeping Aeroplan’s appeal strong. Please consider this feedback to enhance the program’s fairness and inclusivity. Thank you for listening to your customers!",en,5,H Bukhari,MALE,703,"Human Rights Activist, impartial and honest opinion, Travel enthusiast, love nature.",http://twitter.com/hamad_bukh/,Canada,ca,Ottawa,643,19,0,2,21,703,TC1_NA,CA,"[""Travel Enthusiast""]",Travel Enthusiast,"[""Price & Miles""]",Air Canada

Pour la somme colossale de 250 000 dollars, il a acquis l’AAirpass d’American Airlines, un sésame promettant des vols illimités à vie, en première classe, vers n’importe quelle destination de la planète. Ce n’était pas seulement un achat, c’était l’acquisition d’une liberté sans frontières. Pendant plus de deux décennies, Rothstein a mené une existence hors du commun, affranchie des contraintes de temps et de distance. Son quotidien se déroulait entre les fuseaux horaires : un petit-déjeuner à New York, un déjeuner d’affaires à Londres, et un coucher de soleil à Tokyo. On estime qu’il a effectué plus de 10 000 vols, accumulant des dizaines de millions de miles, et coûtant à la compagnie aérienne une somme estimée à plus de 21 millions de dollars. Mais au-delà de l’exploit logistique et du luxe, Rothstein voyait dans cet abonnement une véritable philosophie de vie. Il voyageait parfois sans but précis, simplement pour le plaisir de voler. Mieux encore, il utilisait son privilège pour inviter des inconnus rencontrés dans les aéroports à l’accompagner en première classe, transformant son voyage en un acte de générosité spontanée. Il vivait avec la légèreté d’un oiseau, faisant du monde son voisinage. Cette utopie a pris fin brutalement en 2008. American Airlines, réalisant l’énormité de la perte financière engendrée par ces pass illimités, a cherché une porte de sortie. La compagnie a finalement annulé le pass de Rothstein, l’accusant d’en avoir “trop profité” et de pratiques frauduleuses, notamment l’utilisation de faux noms pour réserver des sièges de compagnon. Bien que la justice ait finalement donné raison à la compagnie en 2011, l’histoire de Steven Rothstein demeure un témoignage fascinant. Il reste l’homme qui a prouvé qu’il était possible, pour un temps, de faire du ciel sa véritable adresse, et dont la légende continue de voler bien au-delà de l’annulation de son billet.

Eastern included the TriStar in their Whisperliner fleet, and when introduced on Caribbean routes it was referred to there as el Grandote (The Big Guy) At PSA the widebody was the Mother Grinning Bird to complement the narrowbody Grinning Birds.

When first introduced into British Airways service, pilots called it the Tripod, and cabin crew allegedly knew it as the Big Dipper because of the increased opportunities for “Dipping” (transferring free First-Class spirits into miniatures for private re-sale in Economy) The “Sunset” mod at BA involved replacing the lower galley and lifts on -200s to create extra freight space. The unusual semi-circle of toilets at the rear was known within Lockheed as Cannery Row (can being US slang for a toilet) and at Caledonian as Penny Lane (“Spending a penny” being British slang for using a toilet) The aforementioned nose-up pitch combined with urine splashes was said to produce a distinctly unpleasant smell on the TriStar, and if the lids were up and thrust-reversal applied on landing the resultant sound was said to be like “gunfire.” The noise-reducing fairing below the intake of the centre engine on the -500 was known as the Frisbee, not because of any resemblance to the throwing disc but because it was devised by Lockheed’s Lloyd Frisbee. BiStar was a reference to engine failures, although it was also used more formally in relation to the unbuilt twin-engined L-1011-600 (aka the CL1600) The only military operator was the UK, who bought 6 ex British Airways L1011-500s in the immediate wake of the 1982 Falklands war, primarily for use as K.1 & KC.1 tankers; these soon became known as Tommies, possibly deriving from the rhyming slang Tommy Tanker (Wanker) A further 3 ex Pan Am -500s were ordered 2 years later as pure C.2 passenger aircraft and given the complementary name of Timmy, with the sole C.2A upgrade sometimes being referred to as Tammy. The two TriStars sent to Saudi Arabia during the first Gulf War and given ”sand pink” camouflage were known collectively as the Pink Pigs or Flying Pigs, and individually as Pinky & Perky after the children’s TV show characters. British charter operator Court Line also had a pink TriStar, G-BAAB “Halcyon Breeze” known within the company as the Pink Lady, operated alongside G-BAAA “Halcyon Days” or the Big Banana.""

It’s hard to see how any company could justify these results. Ultimately, the impacts are clear. The company’s reputation has been damaged, and the fans have borne the burden. Ticket prices were raised, yet the outcome was deeply disappointing. Fans experienced disorganization, last-minute benefit cancellations, and even disrespect toward the thoughtful gifts they prepared. These are loyal supporters who waited years to meet the girls, only to have their love tarnished and treated carelessly by the organizers. IDF should take the time to truly digest fans' feedback and reflect. Even if they are not directly responsible for the organizer’s behaviour, as the client they should have a say in how these issues are handled moving forward. Adding to this is the unfair treatment toward our girls. Visibility matters, yet while international and local media highlighted the tremendous success of the tour and the passionate support of fans, the company itself remained silent on its own social media channels. When your own artists achieve such milestones, acknowledgment should be the minimum.

Without institutions, without enforced norms, there’s only a fragile barrier separating civilization from the chaos of history. We get glimpses of this in war, riots, and moments of lawlessness—but for the most part, societal structure keeps people in line, adhering to an unspoken social contract. Occasionally, though, we see cracks in that structure—reminders of how thin the veil really is. My brother once told me a story about watching Brazilians check in for a flight to the United States. The scene was loud and chaotic—shouting, jostling, cutting in line—because in that environment, securing attention and getting what you need requires forcefulness. In a society where institutions are weaker, you have to act in your own interest because everyone else does. To someone from a highly structured society, this behavior seems aggressive, even rude. But within that system, it’s simply survival. Then, something remarkable happened. The same people, upon entering the first-class lounge of American Airlines in São Paulo, transformed instantly. Gone was the shouting, the shoving, the disorder. Inside the lounge, they adapted to the rules of a structured environment—a space governed by the quiet, orderly expectations of American or Canadian norms. The contrast was stark. This is why institutions matter. They don’t just impose order; they shape behavior itself. When people talk about dismantling these structures, they should tread carefully. Because when the scaffolding of society weakens, history reminds us of what waits on the other side.",en,-5,Andrew Bartels,MALE,1877,Just trying to figure it all out and curate an interesting feed.,http://twitter.com/adb1146/,United States,us,Baltimore,7,1,0,0,1,1877,TC1_NA,US,"[""Tech/Digital""]",Tech/Digital,"[""Seat & Comfort"", ""Service"", ""Lounge""]",American Airlines

Had to change terminal from 5 to 3. From leaving the arriving plane at 5 to sitting down in the Cathay Pacific lounge with champagne took 30 minutes 😂 https://t.co/WnPZunKD7a QT @Noahpinion: Today, I made the mistake of flying from Dublin to Paris via London's Heathrow Airport. This was a remarkably stupid move on my part, given that London, and by extension Heathrow, is located in the failing formerly-developed country known as ""the UK"". I almost paid dearly for this oversight. My layover was 1 hour and 30 minutes. As soon as my flight from Dublin arrived at Terminal 2, I began looking around for my connecting flight to Paris, which was located in Terminal 5. A helpful immigration officer pointed me in the direction of a free train that I could take to Terminal 5. After walking for about 15 minutes through a labyrinthine maze of tunnels, I arrived at this train. The train required me to get a ticket for the free trip to Terminal 5. After standing in line at a machine, I pressed a button that dispensed this ticket. I then used the ticket to go through a turnstyle. Once on the platform (which was poorly labeled), I discovered -- by asking some locals -+ that the trains for Terminal 4 do not actually go to Terminal 5. (This had not been apparent from any signs or other information in the train station.) I would thus have to wait 17 minutes for the dedicated train to Terminal 5. And so wait I did. About 20 minutes later I arrived at Terminal 5, and discovered that I was in the Departures area. Despite the fact that I was transferring, I would have to go through airport security again. So I waited in line for security, watching other people struggle with the automated boarding pass scanners. Finally I reached the scanners, and when I scanned my boarding pass, it registered an error, and told me to see a British Airways employee. (Sadly, my Aer Lingus flight was operated by British Airways.) So I went to the British Airways departures counter, and after a while I found the line I was supposed to stand in. I waited 10 minutes in the line, and was finally allowed to see a British Airways employee. The British Airways employee informed me that I had already missed my flight, since boarding was at 12:15 and it was now 12:17. I argued that boarding would probably last more than two minutes, and that I might still have time to make the flight, whose departure was scheduled for 12:55. She seemed skeptical of this argument, but I finally persuaded her to help me give it a try. Returning me to the security line, the British Airways woman told me to wait in the line (which would have taken 15 minutes). I begged her to let me jump the queue, and she did, explaining my plight to a South Asian security employee who let me through the rope barrier to the front of the line. This South Asian man is actually the hero of our story. When I cut to the front of the security line, a security employee barked at me to get back. The lovely South Asian man then barked at her to let me through, and his confident air of command carried the day. I was let through, and the South Asian man even showed me how to use the security machine so that it would definitely not stop me from entering. He told me to tell his colleagues at the baggage scanner that I was allowed to jump to the front of the queue. I raced to the baggage scanning line, which looked like it would have taken an additional 20 minutes, and simply ducked under the barriers and cut to the front of the line. I apologized to the employee there and told him my flight was already boarding. He told me that in that case, I had already missed my flight, and it wasn't even worth continuing. But I told him that his colleague (the aforementioned South Asian man) had instructed me to go through security anyway, and he accepted this and let me through. I had to do an extra scan of my shoes, but made it through OK. I then ran to my gate, ducking and weaving around various travelers. When I made it to the gate, I found that the flight was still boarding, and they let me through. I then spent 20 minutes standing in line on the jetway. Naturally, my bag didn't arrive in Paris.",en,-5,Hally,FEMALE,505,"Red wine drinker, Real Ale lover.

http://twitter.com/JackCulpan/status/1832373291467862527,2024-09-07 20:00:11,"Hello! This is effectively part zero of a nine part series I will be writing over the coming days about how I am going to gain British Airways Gold Status. I will share everything about the booking process, the flights, airports, cost, and whether I think it’s actually worth it. If you prefer video, I will be sharing updates & reviews over on the Smart With Points TikTok, Instagram & YouTube Kicking Things Off It is important to note that I will be starting from 40 tier points. These were primarily earned through two return journeys in economy with British Airways. I flew from London Heathrow to Manchester for one, and London Gatwick to Jersey for the other. These were my four qualifying flights which are required to progress from Bronze to Silver/Gold. I earned a further 10 tier points from a return economy trip prior with Malaysian Airlines. This was taken before I even thought about attempting a tier point run and yielded a poor TP per £. The Tier Point Run For my tier point run, I'll be embarking on a journey across multiple countries, flying with SriLankan Airlines and Cathay Pacific in business class. The trip kicks off with a flight from Abu Dhabi (AUH) to Colombo (CMB), where I'll have my first layover. From there, I'll head to Jakarta (CGK) and back to Colombo again, with a brief stop before returning to Abu Dhabi. This segment will be crucial for earning a good chunk of tier points as I transit multiple times through Colombo without actually stopping for a long visit. Colombo is situated just over 2000 miles between Abu Dhabi and Jakarta, making it the perfect route to earn tier points. After that, I'll fly from Abu Dhabi to Colombo and Jakarta once again, and then connect with Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong (HKG). From Hong Kong, I'll take a short hop to Taipei (TPE) and back, purely transiting through these cities. I'll then make my way back to Jakarta and switch back to SriLankan Airlines to complete the final legs of my trip, flying from Jakarta to Colombo and ending the run back in Abu Dhabi. Throughout the journey, I'll be stopping briefly in Jakarta and Taipei while purely transiting through places like Hong Kong and Colombo, all in pursuit of maximising my Avios and collecting a total of 1,480 tier points. Last Minute Changes Originally, I was due to fly AUH to CGK and back three times. Although this route earns the most tier points (560 TP x 3), I don’t actually need that many for Gold. It would also mean the whole process would take a day longer, due to the SriLankan only flying 5 days a week to Jakarta. Adding the Cathay Pacific flights in there gets me just the right number of tier points whilst making it more enjoyable trip. Shout out to Matts Planet for the route idea.

He had noticed a girl was waiting for the bathroom and told her to come with him to the first-class bathroom. Before entering the lavatory, Thompson said he needed to wash his hands. When inside the bathroom, he taped his phone to the seat. The girl didn't notice the phone until she got up. She took a picture to show her mother. (seen below) The mother then told her father who confronted Thompson in the back of the plane where a ""kerfuffle"" went down, according to the family's lawyer.

http://twitter.com/JackCulpan/status/1833547235927462261,2024-09-11 01:45:01,"Hello again! Happy Monday. Welcome to the third instalment of my British Airways Gold status adventure. Today, we're covering my journey from Abu Dhabi (AUH) to Jakarta (CGK) via Colombo (CMB). Buckle up for another rollercoaster ride of near-misses, unexpected luxuries, and the ongoing saga of e-visa complications! AUH to CMB: A Comedy of Errors (Almost) Having become somewhat of an AUH expert by now, I decided to cut it fine with my airport arrival. The Pearl Lounge, while nice, isn't exactly the height of luxury (no free cocktails or bubbly - the horror!), so I wasn't too fussed about maximising my time there. However, my nonchalance almost backfired. I'm sitting at gate 15, waiting patiently, when I spot on the board that my flight is boarding... at a completely different gate! Cue a mad dash across the terminal. I made it, but only just, earning myself the title of ""Last to Board."" Pro tip: Always double-check your gate! The silver lining? The plane was practically empty - only about 30 passengers total, with a mere 4 of us living it up in business class. Flight Details: • Dinner: A delightful mutton stew • Beverages: Baileys, and my now-signature peppermint tea • Sleep Quality: Excellent, thanks to familiarity with the seat setup We landed in Colombo a bit early, only to be met with a bus gate. But here's where things got interesting: they shuttled all four of us business class passengers to the terminal separately! I wasn’t expecting that. Colombo Layover: The Quest for Quiet This time in Colombo, I struck gold in the SriLankan Airlines lounge. I discovered a quiet room with some seriously comfy reclining sofas. For two blissful hours, I stretched out in peace, recharging for the next leg of my journey. Once again, the lounge staff's timing was impeccable. They announced our boarding just in time for us to stroll directly onto the plane. No crowded gate lounges for us! CMB to CGK: Sleep is the New Breakfast The flight to Jakarta was considerably busier, but the travel gods smiled upon me once more - I had an open seat next to me. This time, I made the executive decision to skip breakfast in favour of more sleep (and, of course, another peppermint tea). It was definitely the right call; I felt remarkably refreshed upon arrival. Jakarta: The E-Gate Saga Continues Remember my e-gate troubles from last time? Well, they're back with a vengeance. After three failed attempts, I found myself in the unenviable position of queuing for 30 minutes at immigration. The plot thickens: The passport officer informed me that having two visas at the same time is a no-no - apparently, one activates and one cancels. However, he stamped my passport anyway, and I received an email confirming my second visa was activated. The mystery deepens! Hotel Adventures and Future Complications For this stay, I switched things up and tried a different hotel in the hope of getting more sleep. Getting there was an adventure in itself - I narrowly missed the free shuttle and decided to live on the edge by taking a Grab motorbike. Not only was it faster, but it was also way more fun! Now, here's where things get a bit tricky. I'm trying to check in for my upcoming Cathay Pacific flights to Taipei, but the online system is demanding my new Indonesian visa details. The catch? I can't apply for a new e-visa until I exit Indonesia tomorrow. It looks like I'll be heading to the airport tomorrow, fingers crossed, hoping they can check me in for the Taipei flight without these details. Looking Ahead As I sit here in my hotel room having just eaten a Nasi Goreng, contemplating the visa issue that awaits me, I can't help but feel a mix of excitement and trepidation. Will I make it to Taipei without a hitch? Will the e-gates ever accept me? And most importantly, will I ever tire of peppermint tea? Stay tuned for the next instalment of this tier point odyssey. If nothing else, it promises to be... interesting! Until next time, may your connections be smooth and your e-gates cooperative!",en,5,Jack Culpan,MALE,6965,🌐 https://t.co/XVBiVeI5UP 📧 https://t.co/2fkxPQhDXf ✈️ https://t.co/4Zt7JTQvWF 🤖 https://t.co/7PnF4bx1vb (acq) ⚽ TalkFPL (acq @FFH_HQ),http://twitter.com/JackCulpan/,United Kingdom,uk,London,654,3,0,1,4,6965,TC2_EU,UK,[],Unclassified,"[""Seat & Comfort"", ""Food & Dining"", ""Service"", ""Lounge""]",British Airways

Emirates took it further: no chauffeur, no lounge, no baggage, and now bans on children in first class, with business likely next. The message is clear: if you’re not paying cash, you’re not a priority or are you the customer they want in their premium cabins. Airlines don’t profit from your points flights, so they’re taking back control. If, like me, you’re sitting on 500k+ points, you need to get strategic.

When I fly economy, I’m standing at check-in, desperately shifting 3 to 4 pounds in my luggage just to avoid paying extra fees. But when you’re flying first class, you get an extra suitcase AND 20 more pounds per bag—no hassle. It’s clear: if you’ve got the money, you get treated way better. This new policy just adds to the divide. It’s hard to buy into the idea that “all humans are equal” when it’s obvious that the more you pay, the better your experience is.",en,-5,alyssa in the city,FEMALE,113,"fashion enthusiast | truth seeker, doxie devotee 🐾 | purveyor of style, wit & substance",http://twitter.com/shopalyssablack/,Canada,ca,Toronto,21,2,0,0,2,113,TC1_NA,CA,"[""Luxury Lifestyle"", ""Tech/Digital""]",Luxury Lifestyle,"[""Entertainment""]",Air Canada

I’ve flown this route dozens of times for work in the past year, mostly in first class but sometimes in economy as well. I am in seat 10A today, a window seat. There is a non-rev American Airlines captain in the middle seat and another larger passenger in the aisle seat who probably should have purchased two seats All of a sudden, the captain in the middle seat gruffly tells me that the armrest is for use only by the middle seat, and that he should have access to both arm rests. I politely respond that I’m only occupying my seat and ask why he’s being so rude. He responds “because I’m dealing with this situation (pointing to the overweight passenger in the aisle seat) and you’re fucking pushing into my arm” to which I responded politely: I’m staying in my seat. The captain then responds “I can get a flight attendant and I promise you they’ll take my side” to which I responded “probably so, since you’re crew” and he said “I’m the captain?” Question- is this acceptable behavior from an American Airlines captain non-revving? This captain is still sitting next to me in 10B and frankly I’m afraid to say anything else because of his threats to get the flight attendants involved and how “they will take his side”. Use of the F word and cursing as well is unbecoming of an airline captain. I’m not sure how to proceed but I am planning to write a letter to Robert Issom as well. I am hoping the captain is just having a bad day and it’s not of a reflection of who he truly is, because I would be afraid to fly on a plane he is flying in the mood that he is in at the moment.",en,-5,Bilal Farooqui,MALE,4803,i love robots & I'm really mad about what apple did to demerzel; e/acc; we should build our own r. daneel olivaw; building healthcare AI,http://twitter.com/bilalfarooqui/,United States,us,San Francisco,0,0,0,0,0,4803,TC1_NA,US,"[""Tech/Digital""]",Tech/Digital,"[""Seat & Comfort"", ""Service"", ""Lounge"", ""Price & Miles""]",American Airlines

When inside the bathroom, he taped his phone to the seat. The girl didn't notice the phone until she got up. She took a picture to show her mother.

Und dann gibt es Luisa Neubauer, die das Wort „Kampf“ mit „Instagram-Filter“ verwechselt. Sie ist das deutsche Gesicht von Fridays for Future, eine Art Greta Thunberg mit WLAN und Lufthansa-Kundenkarte. Ihr größter Beitrag zur Gesellschaft? Moralpredigten mit erhobenem Zeigefinger, während sie selbst in einer Komfortzone lebt, von der normale Menschen nur träumen können. Neubauer verkauft sich als Stimme der Jugend, als letzte Hoffnung des Planeten – doch unter der Oberfläche findet sich weniger Ideologie als in einer Werbekampagne für nachhaltige Smoothies. Die Erbin aus Zwangsarbeit – Moralische Überlegenheit auf Kosten der Geschichte Luisa Neubauer spricht oft über Gerechtigkeit, doch ihre eigene Familie hat ihr Vermögen nicht gerade mit Fairtrade-Kaffee oder Bio-Avocados verdient. Ihre Familie ist Teil des Reemtsma-Clans, einem Zigarettenimperium, das während der NS-Zeit durch Zwangsarbeit riesige Gewinne erzielte. Nun gut, kann ja keiner was für seine Familie, oder? Doch wenn man sich selbst als moralische Instanz aufspielt, wäre ein Mindestmaß an Selbstreflexion nicht zu viel verlangt. Neubauer jedoch schweigt zu diesem Kapitel lieber – offenbar ist sie zu sehr damit beschäftigt, anderen Leuten zu erklären, wie sie ihr Leben zu führen haben. Der moderne Rattenfänger – mit Filterblase und PR-Team Neubauer hat ein Talent: Sie verkauft grüne Ideologie wie ein Tech-Startup CEO seine neueste App. Einfache Lösungen für komplexe Probleme („Einfach aufhören mit fossilen Energien, dann klappt das!“). Panik als Dauermodus („Die Welt brennt, wir müssen sofort handeln – außer, wenn ich zum nächsten Event fliege!“). Junge Leute mit utopischen Versprechen einfangen, während sie selbst im Luxus lebt. Sie ist der moderne Rattenfänger von Hameln, nur dass sie statt einer Flöte einen Twitter-Account und ein ARD-Mikrofon hat. Während sie mit entrücktem Blick und dramatischen Worten die Apokalypse verkündet, marschiert ihre Gefolgschaft in Richtung wirtschaftlicher Selbstzerstörung – und klatscht dabei begeistert. Fliegen, Feiern, Fordern – Klima-Aktivismus auf First-Class-Niveau Einer ihrer bekanntesten „Ausrutscher“ war die Diskussion um ihre eigenen Flugreisen. Während sie anderen vorschreibt, dass Fliegen böse ist, jettete sie selbst fröhlich durch die Weltgeschichte. Ihre Antwort? „Ich hatte ja keine Wahl.“ Genau. Weil es ja auch keine Züge gibt. Oder Videokonferenzen. Oder einen Funken Konsequenz in ihren eigenen Forderungen. Neubauer lebt in einem Widerspruchskosmos, in dem für sie selbst andere Regeln gelten als für die „dummen Massen“. Während sie sich an Kohlekraftwerken festklebt, um „die Zukunft zu retten“, müssen normale Bürger schauen, wie sie mit explodierenden Energiepreisen klarkommen. Grüne Heuchelei auf höchstem Niveau Neubauer ist die Inkarnation der grünen Doppelmoral. Von Reemtsma-Geld profitieren, aber Kapitalismus abschaffen wollen. Fliegen, aber Flugreisen für andere verteufeln. Grünen Kommunismus fordern, aber selbst luxuriös leben. Während sie den Untergang der Welt predigt, macht sie sich ihre eigene Zukunft goldgrün: Buchverträge, Medienauftritte, Lobbytreffen – ein Aktivismus, der vor allem einem Zweck dient: ihrer eigenen Karriere. Das Fazit: Klima-Heilige oder clevere Geschäftsfrau? Luisa Neubauer ist kein Umweltengel. Sie ist eine perfekt inszenierte PR-Maschine. Ihre Kampagne hat mit echter Wissenschaft oder nachhaltiger Politik so viel zu tun wie ein Tesla mit Umweltschutz – klingt gut, sieht gut aus, ist aber am Ende doch nur Marketing. Die Frage ist: Wie lange lassen sich die Leute noch täuschen? Solange die Kameras blitzen und die Medien sie als „letzte Hoffnung des Planeten“ verkaufen, wird Luisa Neubauer weiter ihre Show abziehen. Doch irgendwann – wenn selbst ihre eigenen Jünger merken, dass sie nichts weiter als ein grünes Hochglanzprodukt ist – könnte ihr Stern genauso schnell verglühen, wie sie ihn selbst angezündet hat. Und dann? Wird sie vielleicht doch noch ins Familienunternehmen einsteigen – und sich einen neuen Slogan überlegen: „Nachhaltig qualmen mit Reemtsma“? #neubauer",de,-5,Volkmarius,MALE,1731,Volljurist und immer neugierig auf das Leben,http://twitter.com/mutabor17/,Germany,de,Essen,0,0,0,0,0,1731,TC2_EU,DE,[],Unclassified,[],Lufthansa

WIR DOCH NICHT 🔴🔴🔴 Abgehoben Abgeordnete dürfen auch auf Kurzstrecke wieder Business-Class fliegen Deutschland 04. Dezember 2025 Autor: JF-Online BERLIN. Der Bundestag hat Abgeordneten wieder mehr Komfort bei Dienstreisen gestattet. Unter Leitung von Parlamentspräsidentin Julia Klöckner (CDU) hat der Ältestenrat beschlossen, daß Bundestagsmitglieder auf Flügen ab zwei Stunden wieder Business-Class buchen dürfen. Die Ampel hatte dies zuvor erst ab vier Stunden erlaubt. Damit wurde eine Regel gekippt, die maßgeblich von der damaligen Bundestagspräsidentin und heutigen Arbeitsministerin Bärbel Bas (SPD) vorangetrieben worden war. Abgeordnete brauchen Platz für Unterlagen Ein Sprecher des Bundestages begründete gegenüber Bild, man habe die geringere Ticketersparnis zwischen zwei und vier Stunden gegen die „Einschränkung der Arbeitsfähigkeit“ abgewogen. Auf solchen Auslandsflügen würden oft vertrauliche Unterlagen vorbereitet. Für Steuerzahler bedeutet der Beschluß höhere Kosten. Ein Ticket von Berlin nach Lissabon kostet am 1. Januar 2026 bei Lufthansa 174 Euro in der Economy-Class, aber 570 Euro in der Business-Class. Zusätzlich kritisieren Oppositionspolitiker, daß der Schritt ein falsches Signal sende, während im Bundestag über weitere finanzielle Belastungen für Bürger diskutiert werde.

You’ll need luck on that trip!” A couple months later my wife went back for a trim. “So, how was Florida?” “Wonderful,” she said. “We flew on a brand-new American airline plane, got bumped to first class, had amazing food and wine, and a handsome young man waited on us hand and foot.” “The hotel had just had a 5 million dollar remodel. They were overbooked and gave us the owner’s suite for free!” “Yeah, yeah,” muttered the hairdresser. “But you didn’t see President Trump.” “Actually,” my wife said, “A secret service agent tapped me on the shoulder and asked if I’d like to meet him privately.” “Five minutes later, President Trump walked in, shook my hand, and spoke to me.” “Oh really?” sneered the hairdresser. “What did he say?” My wife smiled and replied, “Who the hell did your hair, that looks like sh*t, what a loser!”",en,-5,Anita Evans,FEMALE,1657,love the water 💦 believe in ET - it’s all gonna work out 💪,http://twitter.com/AnitaEvans2911/,United States,us,Houston,0,0,0,0,0,1657,TC1_NA,US,[],Unclassified,"[""Seat & Comfort"", ""Food & Dining"", ""Service"", ""Price & Miles"", ""Entertainment""]",American Airlines

The company said demand for premium travel, like first-class and business-class seats, has been growing quickly as more people are willing to pay for extra comfort. This helped Delta’s ticket sales increase faster than expected, and its shares reached a record high. The airline also explained that fewer available seats on flights have led to higher ticket prices, which has boosted its earnings. Delta’s CEO, Ed Bastian, said the airline industry is getting stronger financially and expects this positive trend to continue. Delta believes 2025 will be a record-breaking year for profits, thanks to higher prices and strong demand for travel. The company said travelers are still willing to pay for tickets, even with prices rising, and a strong U.S. dollar is making international trips cheaper for Americans. Delta also expects flights between the U.S. and Europe to bring in a lot of money this year. Even though recent wildfires in Los Angeles slightly hurt sales, they aren’t expected to impact Delta’s overall performance.

Execution &gt; Posing https://t.co/XnzcSkQUU1 QT @kylematthewsceo: Business tip; Whenever you are flying commercial, especially in business/first class, always wear your best business suit & tie combo (business formal). When someone walks on the plane in a great suit, white dress shirt & clean tie, I always think to myself, “I wonder what that guy/gal does for a living.” (Obviously no tie for the ladies ;)) It’s human nature. When I was 22, and now that I am 42, I always find myself wanting ask him/her “hey, what do you do for a living?” If you are in commercial real estate, especially brokerage, by dressing your absolute professional best, people will ask you “what do you do for a living?”, and that’s all you need to get the conversation started. In business/first class, there is a real chance they are in the real estate business, but an even better chance they know someone in the real estate industry, someone who can be your client one day. It is an easy way to network and meet new people, you just have to give a little more effort to dress up and eschew your “I don’t give a sh*t” sweat pants and F-U hoodie. This also works in coach, just to a lesser degree.

Investigators were shocked to find that Thompson had videos of children (aged 7, 9, 11, & 14) from other flights. Thompson was finally caught after an incident in late 2023. He had noticed a girl was waiting for the bathroom and told her to come with him to the first-class bathroom. Before entering the lavatory, Thompson said he needed to wash his hands. When inside the bathroom, he taped his phone to the seat. The girl didn't notice the phone until she got up. She took a picture to show her mother. (seen below) The mother then told her father who confronted Thompson in the back of the plane where a ""kerfuffle"" went down, according to the family's lawyer.

This caused a 5% drop in domestic travel demand. Because of that, Delta is being careful and doesn’t plan to add more flights later this year like they originally thought. But not all parts of the business are struggling—Delta made more money from people buying first-class or premium tickets, and their loyalty program with American Express brought in a record $2 billion. Delta is also doing well in international travel, which makes up about 40% of their business. Places like the Pacific region saw a 16% jump in travel demand, helping balance out the slower domestic market. Even though Delta is unsure about the rest of 2025, especially with the new tariffs causing problems for global trade, they still expect decent results in the second quarter. Lower fuel prices are also helping the airline save money. It looks like this year will be tough for airlines, but Delta’s mix of premium, international, and loyalty program income may help it do better than others.",en,5,Antonio Johnson Show,MALE,2617,"Father and Husband, President of The Linchpin Bunch Inc. and #CAMELS Founder.",http://twitter.com/AJohnsonShow/,United States,us,"Sarasota, Florida",19,1,0,0,1,2617,TC1_NA,US,"[""Business Traveler"", ""Tech/Digital""]",Business Traveler,"[""Seat & Comfort"", ""Price & Miles""]",Delta Air Lines

While working as a flight attendant, Thompson escorted a 14-year-old girl to the first-class lavatory after she found the main cabin restroom occupied. He entered the bathroom beforehand, claiming he needed to wash his hands. The girl discovered an iPhone taped to the underside of the toilet seat lid with red stickers, which Thompson had placed to secretly record her. She took photos of the setup and reported it to her parents, who alerted the crew. The captain then notified law enforcement. Upon landing in Boston, authorities investigated and arrested Thompson later in January 2024 in Lynchburg, Virginia. A search of Thompson’s iCloud account revealed recordings of four additional underage girls (aged 7, 9, 11, and 14) using airplane restrooms on previous flights, along with hundreds of AI-generated sexually explicit images of children and a photo of a 9-year-old unaccompanied minor asleep in her seat. Thompson admitted to using the hidden iPhone to record the girls and collecting a massive trove of child pornography. Outcome: On March 6, 2025, Thompson pleaded guilty in federal court to two counts of sexual exploitation of children and attempt, as well as possession of child pornography and attempt. He faces up to 20 years in prison for the child exploitation charges, with sentencing scheduled for June 2025. The exact sentence has not yet been determined as of March 8, 2025.",en,0,The Fact Checker,MALE,6295,Retired Community Notes Writer: 1️⃣ I find videos with zero context and add it 2️⃣ You find a post and tag me for context 3️⃣ Follow/Like/Retweet more in bio ⬇️,http://twitter.com/The_Facts_Dude/,United States,us,"Washington, D.C.",0,0,0,0,0,6295,TC1_NA,US,"[""Tech/Digital"", ""Creative""]",Tech/Digital,"[""Seat & Comfort"", ""Service""]",American Airlines

RETWEET On July 26, 2025, federal agents swarmed Delta Air Lines Flight 2809 moments after it landed at San Francisco International Airport, arresting co-pilot John Doe on charges of possessing child sexual abuse material, per Fox News. The Boeing 757, delayed nine minutes by fog, had barely reached the gate when ten Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents stormed the cockpit, cuffing Doe and marching him through the cabin as stunned passengers watched. First-class passenger Sarah Christianson called it “rage-inducing,” while the captain, clueless about the feds’ operation, admitted, “I have no idea what just happened.” Delta’s tight-lipped, passing the buck to DHS, which hasn't responded. The child abuse material charges raise chilling questions about who’s flying our planes. This follows a Delta pilot’s arrest in Stockholm for failing a breathalyzer, piling onto concerns about pilot conduct and airline vetting. What’s Delta hiding? Why the secrecy? The public deserves answers, not corporate dodgeball.

Die teilen sie dann in ihren Chatgruppen. Niemand kann das bestreiten. Jeder weiß auch das: Entlang der sogenannten Flüchtlingsrouten blühen Menschenhandel und Schleppertum. Besonders paradox: Die Kosten für die illegale Reise übersteigen schon lange das Business-Class-Ticket in der Lufthansa. Um ""an Bord"" eines dieser Schlauchboote zu kommen, müssen diese jungen Männer unterwegs das Rauben und Morden erlernen. Gleiches gilt an Land für den Platz im Kühl-LKW, immer parallel zur Seidenstraße.

He had noticed a girl was waiting for the bathroom and told her to come with him to the first-class bathroom. Before entering the lavatory, Thompson said he needed to wash his hands. When inside the bathroom, he taped his phone to the seat. The girl didn't notice the phone until she got up. She took a picture to show her mother.

Here's Hans's story reformatted with paragraph breaks for easier reading: I wanted to share a behind the scenes story of what the life of a chess player is really like. Before Wijk Aan Zee, I decided to stop in Vienna on the way to Wijk Aan Zee and I conveniently found a very reasonably priced business class ticket. My trip started rather smoothly, I arrived to the airport early, but when I tried to enter the airport they asked me for a printed version of my boarding pass. I had no wifi, but thankfully a fan recognized me so I offered to take a photo if he shared his hotspot. Alas, I managed to enter the airport where after checking in they told me that because of an equipment shortage they changed aircrafts and had demoted me from business to economy. After lengthy discussions they finally explained that the original plane had 14 business class seats while the new one only had 8 so 6 passengers got the unlucky draw. Regardless, they were accommodating and blocked off an entire row in economy so it was still uncomfortable. Obviously I would not consider this a travel nightmare, but this was only the beginning. I arrived in Abu Dhabi, and was looking forward to the far more comfortable seat on the flight to Vienna. However, shortly before arriving, the captain announced ""10 minutes until landing"", but 30 minutes passed and we didn't land. They eventually announced that due to the weather we had to circle Vienna until we got permission to land. After circling for an hour, the plan was to go to Munich but we were eventually rerouted to Frankfurt. Before we got off the plane in Frankfurt, they told us that the same plane would take us to Vienna at 8pm later that evening. However I saw that there was an 11:45 flight on an earlier airline so I booked that and thought that I could save time. Of course, 1 hour before it's departure, it was cancelled, and all other flights to Vienna were full. Lufthansa automatically rebooked me on a flight to dusseldorf, and then to Vienna. I mean after 24h of travel, continuous cancellations, money wasted. I decided to take the flight to dusseldorf then Vienna which eventually arrived at 7pm. While you might think that this entire story is incredibly negative, this is actually a great omen for my future chess results. Whenever similar travel nightmares occurred, especially during the pandemic, amazing results would follow. So the real moral of the story is that all of my bad luck is gone and that everything should hopefully go my way.",en,0,Grok,UNKNOWN,7501634,https://t.co/fqNKQSiLQB @grok it,http://twitter.com/grok/,United States,us,"Washington, D.C.",11412,59,0,2,64,7501634,TC1_NA,US,[],Unclassified,"[""Seat & Comfort"", ""Price & Miles"", ""Entertainment""]",Lufthansa

It’s now flirting with a $35 billion headline. Elon Musk asked his followers on X whether he should buy Ryanair — not to grow aviation, but to fire its CEO. The spark? Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary publicly mocked Musk, saying he knows “zero about planes” and dismissed Starlink as expensive drag that burns fuel and money. Think of it like this: 🔹 One man sells rockets, satellites, and ambition. 🔹 The other sells €9.99 seats and insults — at scale. Musk fired back the only way Musk knows how: A poll. A joke. And a not-so-joking suggestion that he might just buy the airline. The poll hit 30 million views. Markets barely blinked. Why? Because reality still exists. 🔸 EU airlines must be majority EU-owned 🔸 Non-EU shareholders can’t even vote 🔸 Ryanair is heading toward being debt-free 🔸 And Musk already has Tesla shares pledged from buying Twitter This isn’t a takeover. It’s theatre. And both men know it. Ryanair trolls back. Musk escalates. The internet eats it up. It’s like two pub fighters throwing punches across the bar — knowing full well the bouncer (regulation, capital, gravity) isn’t letting it turn into a real fight. 🟢 FINAL THOUGHT This was never about WiFi. It’s about dominance, attention, and narrative control. In markets, investors ignore noise. In media, noise is the product. And right now, both men are flying first class on it.
